CleanTrack: A Technology-Driven Waste Collection Support System
This project is a web-based application built with PHP (CodeIgniter) to support and digitize municipal waste management, based on a case study of the "Ghanta Gadi Initiative".

CleanTrack helps municipalities streamline HR and logistics by tracking vehicle routes, managing drivers, and monitoring household collection status in real-time.

Collection Tracking: View a list of "Scanned Households" to monitor real-time collection status.


Data Management: Centralized system for managing all drivers, households, and collection data.
